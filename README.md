## üöÄ The MVP Concept

Welcome to **FamiliQuest**, an application designed to transform everyday household tasks into an engaging and collaborative role-playing game for the entire family. For the **"Game of Life" hackathon**, this Minimum Viable Product (MVP) focuses on the core gameplay loop: creating a simple, fun, and balanced system for assigning chores, tracking progress, and rewarding consistency.

In FamiliQuest, parents act as **Quest Masters**, assigning tasks to their children, the **Adventurers**. The goal is to foster responsibility and teamwork through positive reinforcement and gentle accountability.

## ‚ú® Key MVP Features

### 1. Simplified Quest & Task System

- **Quest Master Controls:** Parents can easily assign tasks from a curated list of common household chores (e.g., "Make Your Bed," "Help with Dishes," "Feed the Pet"), making setup quick and effortless.
- **Proof of Completion:** For certain tasks, parents can require a photo to be uploaded as proof. The quest is only marked as complete after parental verification.
- **Wellness Habit:** A special, recurring quest to track a healthy sleep schedule, rewarding children with significant XP for consistency.
- **Parental Quests:** Parents can also assign quests to themselves to model teamwork and shared responsibility.

### 2. Gentle Consequence & Energy System

- **Stamina Bar:** Each Adventurer has a "Stamina" bar. Completing quests costs a small amount of Stamina, which regenerates automatically over time. This prevents burnout and teaches energy management.
- **Missed Quest Consequences:** To encourage follow-through, missing a quest has a gentle consequence:
  - **Streak Loss:** The daily streak bonus is reset to zero.
  - **Stamina Cooldown:** Stamina regeneration is temporarily slowed for a short period. This system avoids harsh punishment while still making actions meaningful.

### 3. Persona & Progression

- **Build Your Persona:** Completing quests earns Experience Points (XP), which contributes to a user's level and in-app persona.
- **Customizable Avatars:** Each family member gets a personal avatar. Leveling up unlocks new cosmetic items and accessories.
- **Experience & Levels:** Adventurers earn XP for every completed quest, allowing them to level up and unlock new avatar items.
- **Streak Bonuses:** To motivate consistency, the system rewards daily streaks. Completing quests for several days in a row grants escalating XP bonuses.
- **Badges & Titles:** Key milestones and achievements award unique, collectible badges (e.g., "5-Day Streak!") and titles (e.g., "Tidiness Apprentice").

### 4. The Family Unit: Stronger Together

- **Collaborative Family Persona:** The family itself has a collective profile that levels up as its members complete quests. This encourages teamwork over individual competition.
- **Weekly Family Quest:** Instead of complex "Boss Battles," the MVP features a single, larger "Family Quest" each week (e.g., "Tidy the Living Room Together"). Completing it gives a massive XP boost to the Family Persona and unlocks a group reward, like choosing a weekend movie or meal.

## üõ†Ô∏è Future Scopes

### 1. üß† Smart Quest Suggestions (AI-Based)

Leverage AI/ML to automatically recommend age-appropriate, skill-relevant quests for each child based on:
- Past performance and skill trees.
- Calendar events (e.g., exam week = more academic quests).
- Season or time of year (e.g., ‚ÄúClean the yard‚Äù during monsoons).
- Behavioral analytics to balance fun and responsibility.

### 2. üì∏ OCR-Based Task Verification

Introduce Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to verify task completion through images. For example:
- Homework snapshots auto-verified by detecting subject keywords.
- ‚ÄúClean Room‚Äù photo can be checked for clutter detection or changes over time.
- Combine with AI to generate a cleanliness score.

This reduces parent workload while increasing trust and automation.

### 3. üì≤ Mobile App Integration (React Native)

Convert the web app into a full-fledged mobile application using React Native for:
- Push notifications for quest reminders or streak alerts.
- Camera access for instant proof submissions.
- Offline support for better accessibility.
