# FamiliQuest

*Turn Your Family Chores into Epic Adventures!*

A gamified chore management application built for the "Game of Life" hackathon. FamiliQuest transforms household tasks into a collaborative role-playing game, fostering responsibility and teamwork within the family.

### The Problem

Household chores are often a source of friction and negotiation in families. Traditional methods like chore charts can feel like a burden, leading to a lack of motivation for children and added stress for parents. This can make it difficult to teach responsibility and teamwork effectively.

---

### Our Solution

**FamiliQuest** reframes chores as "quests" in a family-wide adventure.

- **Parents** act as **Quest Masters**, assigning tasks and verifying completion.
- **Children** become **Adventurers**, completing quests to earn Experience Points (XP), level up their avatars, and unlock rewards.
- The **Family** works together on larger goals, strengthening their bond.

This approach uses positive reinforcement and gentle accountability to make chores engaging and rewarding, turning a mundane routine into a fun, collaborative game.


### Key Features

#### 1. Quest & Task System
- **Quest Master Controls:** Parents assign tasks from a pre-made list of common chores.
- **Proof of Completion:** Option to require a photo upload for verification on certain tasks.
- **Wellness Habit:** A special recurring quest to track healthy habits like sleep schedules.
- **Parental Quests:** Parents can assign quests to themselves to model teamwork.

#### 2. Gentle Consequence & Energy System
- **Stamina Bar:** Completing quests costs Stamina, which regenerates over time to teach energy management and prevent burnout.
- **Missed Quest Consequences:** Instead of punishment, missing a quest resets the daily streak bonus and temporarily slows Stamina regeneration.

#### 3. Persona & Progression
- **Customizable Avatars:** Each family member customizes a personal avatar.
- **Experience & Levels:** Earn XP for completed quests to level up and unlock new cosmetic items.
- **Streak Bonuses:** Daily streaks grant escalating XP bonuses to encourage consistency.
- **Badges & Titles:** Milestones unlock unique, collectible badges and titles.

#### 4. The Family Unit
- **Collaborative Family Persona:** The entire family has a collective profile that levels up as members complete quests.
- **Weekly Family Quest:** A large, collaborative quest each week that boosts the family level and unlocks a group reward (e.g., choosing a weekend movie).
